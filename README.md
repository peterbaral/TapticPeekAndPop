# TapticPeekAndPop

A very basic example of how to call the "Peek" and "Poke" haptic feedback. 
It's private actuation methods are hidden in `UIDevice` and `_UITapticEngine` classes and are called by `UIPreviewInteractionController` when appropriate.

## Research

The methods and classes for Taptic Engine can be found using [**Runtime Headers**](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers), look for `UIDevice` and `_UITapticEngine` classes.


## Requirements

### Build

iOS 9 SDK, Xcode 7

### Runtime

iOS 9 (and an iPhone 6s/6s Plus). Doesn't work in the Xcode simulator!
